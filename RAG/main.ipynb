Beam allocation is the process of assigning users to specific beams based on their location and the available beams in the system.

      "Beam management is a key technology in 5G wireless communications that allows for the efficient use of radio frequency (RF) resources and improved network performance. It involves the use of multiple antennas at the base station and the mobile device to create a beam of radio waves that is directed towards the device, rather than broadcasting in all directions. This allows for a more focused and efficient use of RF resources, which can lead to improved data rates, reduced latency, and increased capacity in the network. Beam management can also be used to improve the signal quality for devices that are located in areas with poor signal strength, by directing the beam towards the device and reducing interference from other sources.\n"
