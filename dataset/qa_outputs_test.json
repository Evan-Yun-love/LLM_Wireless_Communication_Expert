In particular, OFDMA\nis well suited for high data-rate transmissions over delay-dispersive channels, realized\nby exploiting the principle of divide and conquer. Accordingly, OFDMA is\ncomputationally efficient in using the FFT algorithm. Moreover, OFDMA lends itself\nto the combined use of MIMO, hence the ability to improve spectral efficiency and\ntake advantage of channel flexibility.\nCode-division multiple access (CDMA), which distinguishes itself by exploiting the\nunderlying principle of spread spectrum signals, discussed in Section 9.13. To be\nspecific, through the combined process of spectrum spreading in the transmitter and\ncorresponding spectrum despreading in the receiver, a certain amount of processing\ngain is obtained, hence the ability of CDMA users to occupy the same channel\nbandwidth. Moreover, CDMA provides a flexible procedure for the allocation of\nresources (i.e., PN codes) among a multiplicity of active users. Last but by no means\nleast, in using the RAKE, viewed as an adaptive TDL filter, CDMA is enabled to\nmatch the receiver input to the channel output by adjusting tap delays as well as tap\nweights, thereby enhancing receiver performance in the presence of multipath.\nTo conclude, OFDMA and CDMA provide two different approaches for the multiple\naccess of active users to wireless channels, each one of which builds on its own distinctive\nfeatures.\nProblems\nEffect of Flat Fading on the BER of Digital Communications Receivers Derive the BER formulas listed in the right-hand side of Table 9.2 for the following signaling\nschemes over flat fading channels:\na.

However, since\nthe transmitter does not know what the channel gains are, a reasonable strategy is to\nallocate equal power P to each of the sub-channels. In Section 5.3.3, it was mentioned\nthat the maximum rate of reliable communication given the fading gains hs is\nL X =1 log  1 + |h|2SNR  bits/s/Hz, (5.80) where SNR = P/N0.

In Chapter 3, multiple antennas were used to provide diversity gain and\nincrease the reliability of wireless links. Both receive and transmit diversity were con-\nsidered. Moreover, receive antennas can also provide a power gain. In Chapter 5, we\nsaw that with channel knowledge at the transmitter, multiple transmit antennas can\nalso provide a power gain via transmit beamforming. In Chapter 6, multiple transmit\nantennas were used to induce channel variations, which can then be exploited by op-\nportunistic communication techniques. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic\nbeamforming and provides a power gain as well.\nIn this and the next few chapters, we will study a new way to use multiple antennas.\nWe will see that under suitable channel fading conditions, having both multiple transmit\nand multiple receive antennas (i.e., a MIMO channel) provides an additional spatial\ndimension for communication and yields a degree-of-freedom gain. These additional\ndegrees of freedom can be exploited by spatially multiplexing several data streams onto\nthe MIMO channel, and lead to an increase in the capacity: the capacity of such a\nMIMO channel with n transmit and receive antennas is proportional to n.\nHistorically, it has been known for a while that a multiple access system with mul-\ntiple antennas at the base station allows several users to simultaneously communicate\nwith the base station. The multiple antennas allow spatial separation of the signals\nfrom the dierent users. It has been observed in the mid 1990s that a similar eect\ncan occur for a point-to-point channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas,\ni.e., even when the transmit antennas are not geographically far apart. This holds\nprovided that the scattering environment is rich enough to allow the receive antennas",

F stands for frame and SF for\nsubframe.\nIn 5G NR, SRS parameters, such as periodicity and offset, are typically configured by RRC and notified to UE [TS38331].\nAnother option is to have gNB MAC scheduler to determine the SRS periodicity/offset and then to notify UE through\nDCI format 2_3 on which resources SRS should be transmitted [TS38212]. The latter option, scheduling-based SRS, is\na more dynamic approach and allows more flexible SRS parameter and periodicity assignment, e.g., when there are less\nUEs, a lower periodicity value can be used, while when there are more UEs, the gNB MAC scheduler can dynamically\nincrease the periodicity and then update the offsets accordingly. We have implemented scheduling-based SRS.\nTo allow dynamic SRS scheduling and adjustment of SRS periodicity/offset of all UEs, we introduced NrMacSched-\nulerSrs and NrMacSchedulerSrsDefault into 5G-LENA model.\nNrMacSchedulerSrs is an interface that is used by the NR gNB MAC scheduler to obtain the SRS offset/periodicity\nfor a UE.

For this reason, the terms Fourier transform and\nspectrum are used interchangeably. Thus, given a signal g(t) with Fourier transform G(f),\nwe may refer to G(f) as the spectrum of the signal g(t). By the same token, we refer to\n|G(f)| as the magnitude spectrum of the signal g(t), and refer to arg[G(f)] as its phase\nspectrum.\nIf the signal g(t) is real valued, then the magnitude spectrum of the signal is an even\nfunction of frequency f, while the phase spectrum is an odd function of f. In such a case,\nknowledge of the spectrum of the signal for positive frequencies uniquely defines the\nspectrum for negative frequencies.\nNotations\nFor convenience of presentation, it is customary to express (2.17) in the short-hand form\nwhere F plays the role of an operator. In a corresponding way, (2.18) is expressed in the\nshort-hand form\nwhere F-1 plays the role of an inverse operator.\nThe time function g(t) and the corresponding frequency function G(f) are said to\nconstitute a Fourier-transform pair.

The effect of a\nrotation applied to all the message points in a constellation is equivalent to multiplying the\nN-dimensional signal vector si by an N-by-N orthonormal matrix denoted by Q for all i.\nBy definition, the matrix Q satisfies the condition\n(7.64)\nwhere the superscript T denotes matrix transposition and I is the identity matrix whose\ndiagonal elements are all unity and its off-diagonal elements are all zero. According to\n(7.64), the inverse of the real-valued orthonormal matrix Q is equal to its own transpose.\nThus, in dealing with rotation, the message vector si is replaced by its rotated version\n(7.65)\nCorrespondingly, the N-by-1 noise vector w is replaced by its rotated version\n(7.66)\nHowever, the statistical characteristics of the noise vector are unaffected by this rotation\nfor three reasons:\nFrom Chapter 4 we recall that a linear combination of Gaussian random variables is\nalso Gaussian. Since the noise vector w is Gaussian, by assumption, then it follows\nthat the rotated noise vector wrotate is also Gaussian.\nSince the noise vector w has zero mean, the rotated noise vector wrotate also has zero\nmean, as shown by\n(7.67)\nThe covariance matrix of the noise vector w is equal to (N02)I, where N02 is the\npower spectral density of the AWGN w(t) and I is the identity matrix; that is\n(7.68)\nHence, the covariance matrix of the rotated noise vector is\n(7.69)\nwhere, in the last two lines, we have made use of (7.68) and (7.64).\nIn light of these three reasons, we may, therefore, express the observation vector in the\nrotated message constellation as\n(7.70) QQT I = si rotate  Qsi i 1 2 M   =  = wrotate Qw = \u0003 wrotate   \u0003 Qw   = Q\u0003 w   = 0 = \u0003 wwT   N0 2 ------I = \u0003 wrotatewrotate T   \u0003 Qw Qw  T   = \u0003 QwwTQT   = Q\u0003 wwT  QT = N0 2 ------QQT = N0 2 ------I = xrotate Qsi w i 1 2 M   =  + =",

[105] considered an array of discrete antenna elements,\nwhile [90, 92] considered a continuum of antenna elements to emphasize that spatial\nmultiplexability is limited not by the number of antenna elements but by the size of the\nantenna array. We considered only linear arrays in this chapter, but [90] also treated\nother antenna array configurations such as circular rings and spherical surfaces. The\ndegree-of-freedom formula 7.78 is derived in [90] for the clustered response model.\nOther related approaches to MIMO channel modeling are by Raleigh and Cio[97],\nby Gesbert et. al. [47] and by Shiu et. al. [111]. The latter work used a Clarke-like\nmodel but with two rings of scatterers, one around the transmitter and one around the\nreceiver, to derive the MIMO channel statistics.\n5 Exercises Exercise 7.1. 1.

In light of (7.221), the binary-hypothesis test may now be formulated as follows:\nThe modified Bessel function I() is a monotonically increasing function of its argument.\nHence, we may simplify the hypothesis test by focusing on i for given E/N0T.

    "context": "Tse and Viswanath: Fundamentals of Wireless Communications B.3.4\nOperational Interpretation\nThere is a common misconception which needs to be pointed out. In solving the input\ndistribution optimization problem (B.22) for the capacity C, it was remarked that\nat the optimal solution, the outputs y[m]s should be independent, and one way to\nachieve this is for the inputs x[m]s to be independent. Does that imply no coding is\nneeded to achieve capacity? For example, in the binary symmetric channel, the optimal\ninput yields i.i.d. equally likely symbols; does it mean then we can send equally likely\ninformation bits raw across the channel and still achieve capacity?\nOf course not: to get very small error probability one needs to code over many\nsymbols. The fallacy of the above argument is that reliable communication cannot be\nachieved at exactly the rate C and when the outputs are exactly independent. Indeed,\nwhen the outputs and inputs are i.i.d,\nH(x|y) = NXm=1 H(x[m]|y[m]) = NH(x[m]|y[m]),\n(B.32)\nand there is a lot of uncertainty in the input given the output: the communication\nis hardly reliable. But once one shoots for a rate strictly less than C, no matter how\nclose, the coding theorem guarantees that reliable communication is possible. The\nmutual information I(x; y)/N per symbol is close to C, the outputs y[m]s are almost\nindependent, but now the conditional entropy H(x|y) is reduced abruptly to (close\nto) zero since reliable decoding is possible. But to achieve this performance, coding is\ncrucial; indeed the entropy per input symbol is close to I(x; y)/N, less than H(x[m])\nunder uncoded transmission. For the binary symmetric channel, the entropy per coded\nsymbol is 1 H(), rather than 1 for uncoded symbols.\nThe bottomline is that while the value of the input optimization problem (B.22) has\noperational meaning as the maximum rate of reliable communication, it is incorrect\nto interpret the i.i.d. input distribution which attains that value as the statistics of",

The classical\ndiversity gain is the diversity gain at a fixed rate, i.e., the multiplexing gain r = 0.\nThe optimal diversity gain d(r) is determined by the outage probability of the\nchannel at a data rate of r log SNR bits/s/Hz. The operational interpretation is\nvia the existence of a universal code that achieves reliable communication\nsimultaneously over all channels that are not in outage.\nThe universal code viewpoint provides a new code design criterion.

    "context": "Chapter\nConversion of Analog Waveforms into Coded Pulses Quantization and its Statistical Characterization\nTypically, an analog message signal (e.g., voice) has a continuous range of amplitudes\nand, therefore, its samples have a continuous amplitude range. In other words, within the\nfinite amplitude range of the signal, we find an infinite number of amplitude levels. In\nactual fact, however, it is not necessary to transmit the exact amplitudes of the samples for\nthe following reason: any human sense (the ear or the eye) as ultimate receiver can detect\nonly finite intensity differences. This means that the message signal may be approximated\nby a signal constructed of discrete amplitudes selected on a minimum error basis from an\navailable set. The existence of a finite number of discrete amplitude levels is a basic\ncondition of waveform coding exemplified by PCM. Clearly, if we assign the discrete\namplitude levels with sufficiently close spacing, then we may make the approximated\nsignal practically indistinguishable from the original message signal. For a formal\ndefinition of amplitude quantization, or just quantization for short, we say:\nQuantization is the process of transforming the sample amplitude m(nTs) of a\nmessage signal m(t) at time t = nTs into a discrete amplitude v(nTs) taken from a\nfinite set of possible amplitudes.\nThis definition assumes that the quantizer (i.e., the device performing the quantization\nprocess) is memoryless and instantaneous, which means that the transformation at time\nt = nTs is not affected by earlier or later samples of the message signal m(t). This simple\nform of scalar quantization, though not optimum, is commonly used in practice.\nWhen dealing with a memoryless quantizer, we may simplify the notation by dropping\nthe time index. Henceforth, the symbol mk is used in place of m(kTs), as indicated in the\nblock diagram of a quantizer shown in Figure 6.8a. Then, as shown in Figure 6.8b, the",

This will be useful when we deal with other\nmore complicated wireless channel models later on. To this end, one can think of the\ndierential entropy of a complex random variable x as that of a real random vector\n((x), (x)). Hence, if w is CN(0, N0), h(w) = h((w)) + h((w)) = log (eN0).

Let us now turn to the analogous\nsituation in the downlink where the single transmitter tracks all the channels of the\nusers it is communicating to (the users continue to track their individual channels).\nAs in the uplink, we can allocate powers to the users as a function of the channel fade\nlevel.

We have seen that\nwithout fading, the sum capacity is achieved by transmitting only to the best user.\nNow as the channels vary, we can pick the best user at each time and further allocate\nit an appropriate power subject to a constraint on the average power.\nUnder this\nstrategy, the downlink channel reduces to a point-to-point channel with the channel\ngain distributed as: max k=1...K |hk|2.

The average throughputs Tk[m] are updated\nusing an exponentially weighted low-pass filter:\nTk[m + 1] =    (1 1 tc)Tk[m] + 1 tcRk[m] k = k (1 1 tc)Tk[m] k = k. (6.56) One can get an intuitive feel of how this algorithm works by inspecting Figures 6.14\nand 6.15. We plot the sample paths of the requested data rates of two users as a\nfunction of time slots (each time slot is 1.67 ms in IS-856). In Figure 6.14, the two\nusers have identical fading statistics. If the scheduling time-scale tc is much larger than\nthe correlation time-scale of the fading dynamics, then by symmetry the throughput of\neach user Tk[m] converges to the same quantity. The scheduling algorithm reduces to\nalways picking the user with the highest requested rate. Thus, each user is scheduled\nwhen its channel is good and at the same time the scheduling algorithm is perfectly\nfair in the long term.\nIn Figure 6.15, due to perhaps dierent distances from the base station, one users\nchannel is much stronger than that of the other user on average, even though both\nchannels fluctuate due to multipath fading. Always picking the user with the highest\nrequested rate means giving all the system resources to the statistically stronger user,\nand would be highly unfair. In contrast, under the scheduling algorithm described\nabove, users compete for resources not directly based on their requested rates but\nbased on the rates normalized by their respective average throughputs. The user with\nthe statistically stronger channel will have a higher average throughput.\nThus, the algorithm schedules a user when its instantaneous channel quality is high\nrelative to its own average channel condition over the time-scale tc. In short, data is\ntransmitted to a user when its channel is near its own peaks. Multiuser diversity benefit",

The term fast refers to the speed\nof fluctuations in the received signal due to these reflections, relative to the speeds of other\npropagation phenomena. Compared with transmit data rates, even fast fading can be\nrelatively slow. That is, fast fading can be approximately constant over a number of\ntransmission symbols, depending upon the data transmission speed and the mobile units\nvelocity. Consequently, fast fading may be viewed as a time-correlated form of channel\nimpairment, the presence of which results in statistical dependence among continuous\n(sets of) symbol transmissions.

Viewed in this manner, there are two\nkinds of distributions: 1. Central distribution, which is produced when the Gaussian random variable has\nzero mean.\nNoncentral distribution, which is produced when the Gaussian random variable\nhas a nonzero mean.\nIn this appendix, we will discuss only the central form of the distribution.\nConsider, then, a standard Gaussian random variable X, which has zero mean and unit\nvariance, as shown by\n(A.1)\nLet the variable X be applied to a square-law device, producing a new random variable Y,\nwhose sample value is defined by\n(A.2) or, equivalently, (A.3) The cumulative distribution function of the random variable Y produced at the output of\nthe square-law device is therefore defined by\n(A.4) 2 2 2 2 fX x  1 2 ---------- x2 2----- -      x    -  exp = y x2 = x y  = FY y  fX x  dx y - y  =",

When in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED, if broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI discontinuously using the broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity monitors each PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause is performed independently for each G-RNTI and independently from the DRX operation specified in clauses 5.7 and 5.7b. RRC controls broadcast DRX operation by configuring the following parameters: -\tdrx-onDurationTimerPTM: the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle; -\tdrx-SlotOffsetPTM: the delay before starting the drx-onDurationTimerPTM; -\tdrx-InactivityTimerPTM: the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new DL broadcast transmission for the MAC entity; -\tdrx-LongCycleStartOffsetPTM: the long DRX cycle drx-LongCycle-PTM and drx-StartOffset-PTM which defines the subframe where the DRX cycle starts.

In effect, by adopting the SRRC spectrum G( f) of\n(8.33) for pulse shaping, we would be working with G2(f ) = P( f) in an overall\ntransmitter-receiver sense. On this basis, we find that in wireless communications, for\nexample, if the channel is affected by both fading and AWGN and the pulse-shape filtering\nis partitioned equally between the transmitter and the receiver in the manner described\nherein, then effectively the receiver would maximize the output SNR at the sampling\ninstants.\nThe inverse Fourier transform of (8.33) defines the SRRC shaping pulse:\n(8.34)\nThe important point to note here is the fact that the SRRC shaping pulse g(t) of (8.34) is\nradically different from the conventional RC shaping pulse of (8.25).

    "context": "8 Channel-coding Theorem The channel encoder and channel decoder in Figure 5.11 are both under the designers\ncontrol and should be designed to optimize the overall reliability of the communication\nsystem. The approach taken is to introduce redundancy in the channel encoder in a\ncontrolled manner, so as to reconstruct the original source sequence as accurately as\npossible. In a rather loose sense, we may thus view channel coding as the dual of source\ncoding, in that the former introduces controlled redundancy to improve reliability whereas\nthe latter reduces redundancy to improve efficiency.\nTreatment of the channel-coding techniques is deferred to Chapter 10. For the purpose\nof our present discussion, it suffices to confine our attention to block codes. In this class of\ncodes, the message sequence is subdivided into sequential blocks each k bits long, and\neach k-bit block is mapped into an n-bit block, where n > k. The number of redundant bits\nadded by the encoder to each transmitted block is n - k bits. The ratio kn is called the code\nrate. Using r to denote the code rate, we write\n(5.61)\nwhere, of course, r is less than unity. For a prescribed k, the code rate r (and, therefore, the\nsystems coding efficiency) approaches zero as the block length n approaches infinity.\nThe accurate reconstruction of the original source sequence at the destination requires\nthat the average probability of symbol error be arbitrarily low. This raises the following\nimportant question:\nDoes a channel-coding scheme exist such that the probability that a message bit\nwill be in error is less than any positive number  (i.e., as small as we want it),\nand yet the channel-coding scheme is efficient in that the code rate need not be\ntoo small?\nThe answer to this fundamental question is an emphatic yes. Indeed, the answer to the\nquestion is provided by Shannons second theorem in terms of the channel capacity C, as\ndescribed in what follows.",

    "context": "Chapter\nSignaling over Fading Channels Code-Division Multiple Access\nModern wireless networks are commonly of a multiuser type, in that the multiple\ncommunication links within the network are shared among multiple users. Specifically,\neach individual user is permitted to share the available radio resources (i.e., time and\nfrequency) with other users in the network and do so in an independent manner.\nStated in another way, a multiple access technique permits the radio resources to be\nshared among multiple users seeking to communicate with each other. In the context of\ntime and frequency domains, we recall from Chapter 1 that frequency-division multiple\naccess (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) techniques allocate the radio\nresources of a wireless channel through the use of disjointedness (i.e., orthogonality) in\nfrequency and time, respectively. On the other hand, the code-division multiple access\n(CDMA) technique, building on spread spectrum signals and benefiting from their\nattributes, provides an alternative to the traditional techniques of FDMA and TDMA; it\ndoes so by not requiring the bandwidth allocation of FDMA nor the time synchronization\nneeded in TDMA. Rather, CDMA operates on the following principle:\nThe users of a common wireless channel are permitted access to the channel\nthrough the assignment of a spreading code to each individual user under the\numbrella of spread spectrum modulation.\nThis statement is testimony to what we said in the first paragraph of Section 9.13, namely\nthat spread spectrum signals provide a novel way of thinking about wireless\ncommunications.\nTo elaborate on the way in which CDMA distinguishes itself from FDMA and TDMA\nin graphical terms, consider Figure 9.32. Parts a and b of the figure depict the ways in\nwhich the radio resources are distributed in FDMA and TDMA, respectively. To be\nspecific:",

(See Exercise 10.13.) With this choice of transmit strategy, the pair of\nrates (R1, R2) at which users can jointly reliably communicate is constrained, as in\n(10.12) and (10.13), by:\nRk  E  log det  Inr + 1 N0 HkKxkH k  , k = 1, 2, (10.28) R1 + R2  E \" log det  Inr + 1 N0 2 X k=1 HkKxkH k !# . (10.29) This constraint forms a pentagon and the corner points are achieved by the architec-\nture of linear MMSE filter combined with successive cancellation of data streams (c.f.\nFigure 10.12).\nThe capacity region is the convex hull of the union of these pentagons, one for\neach power allocation to the data streams of the users (i.e., the diagonal entries of\n1, 2). In the point-to-point MIMO channel, with some additional symmetry (such\nas in the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading model), we have seen that the capacity achieving power\nallocation is equal powers to the data streams (c.f. (8.12)). An analogous result holds\nin the MIMO uplink as well. With i.i.d. Rayleigh fading for all the users, the equal\npower allocation to the data streams, i.e.,\nKxk = Pk ntk Intk, (10.30) achieves the entire capacity region; thus in this case the capacity region is simply a\npentagon. (See Exercise 10.14.)\nThe analysis of the capacity region with full CSI is very similar to our previous\nanalysis (c.f. Section 10.1.5). Due to the increase in number of parameters to feedback\n(so that the users can change their transmit strategies as a function of the time varying\nchannels), this scenario is also somewhat less relevant in engineering practice.

    "context": "582 Chapter 10 Error-Control Coding Notation Many of the codes described in this chapter are binary codes, for which the alphabet\nconsists only of binary symbols 0 and 1. In such a code, the encoding and decoding\nfunctions involve the binary arithmetic operations of modulo-2 addition and multiplication\nperformed on codewords in the code.\nThroughout this chapter, we use the ordinary plus sign (+) to denote modulo-2 addition.\nThe use of this terminology will not lead to confusion because the whole chapter relies on\nbinary arithmetic. In so doing, we avoid use of the special symbol as we did in previous\nparts of the book. Thus, according to the notation used in this chapter, the rules for\nmodulo-2 addition are as follows:\nBecause 1 + 1 = 0, it follows that 1 = -1. Hence, in binary arithmetic, subtraction is the\nsame as addition. The rules for modulo-2 multiplication are as follows:\nDivision is trivial, in that we have\nand division by 0 is not permitted. Modulo-2 addition is the EXCLUSIVE-OR operation\nin logic and modulo-2 multiplication is the AND operation.\n4 Linear Block Codes By definition: A code is said to be linear if any two codewords in the code can be added in\nmodulo-2 arithmetic to produce a third codeword in the code.\nConsider, then, an (n,k) linear block code, in which k bits of the n code bits are always\nidentical to the message sequence to be transmitted. The (n - k) bits in the remaining\nportion are computed from the message bits in accordance with a prescribed encoding rule\nthat determines the mathematical structure of the code. Accordingly, these (n - k) bits are\nreferred to as parity-check bits. Block codes in which the message bits are transmitted in\nunaltered form are called systematic codes. For applications requiring both error detection\nand error correction, the use of systematic block codes simplifies implementation of the\ndecoder.\nLet m0, m1, , mk - 1 constitute a block of k arbitrary message bits. Thus, we have 2k",
