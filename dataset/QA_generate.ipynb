In this first section of the introductory chapter we present some historical notes\\nthat identify the pioneering contributors to digital communications specifically, focusing\\non three important topics: information theory and coding, the Internet, and wireless\\ncommunications. In their individual ways, these three topics have impacted digital\\ncommunications in revolutionary ways.\\nInformation Theory and Coding\\nIn 1948, the theoretical foundations of digital communications were laid down by Claude\\nShannon in a paper entitled A mathematical theory of communication. Shannons paper\\nwas received with immediate and enthusiastic acclaim. It was perhaps this response that\\nemboldened Shannon to amend the title of his classic paper to The mathematical theory\\nof communication when it was reprinted later in a book co-authored with Warren Weaver.\\nIt is noteworthy that, prior to the publication of Shannons 1948 classic paper, it was\\nbelieved that increasing the rate of transmission over a channel would increase the\\nprobability of error; the communication theory community was taken by surprise when\\nShannon proved that this was not true, provided the transmission rate was below the\\nchannel capacity.\\nShannons 1948 paper was followed by three ground-breaking advances in coding\\ntheory, which include the following:\\nDevelopment of the first nontrivial error-correcting code by Golay in 1949 and\\nHamming in 1950.\\nDevelopment of turbo codes by Berrou, Glavieux and Thitimjshima in 1993; turbo\\ncodes provide near-optimum error-correcting coding and decoding performance in\\nadditive white Gaussian noise.\\nRediscovery of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which were first described\\nby Gallager in 1962; the rediscovery occurred in 1981 when Tanner provided a new',\n",

However, the most\\nsignificant of them all in terms of impact on computer communications was the Advanced\\nResearch Project Agency Network (ARPANET), which was put into service in 1971. The\\ndevelopment of ARPANET was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency\\n(ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. The pioneering work in packet\\nswitching was done on the ARPANET. In 1985, ARPANET was renamed the Internet.\\nHowever, the turning point in the evolution of the Internet occurred in 1990 when Berners-\\nLee proposed a hypermedia software interface to the Internet, which he named the World\\nWide Web. Thereupon, in the space of only about 2 years, the Web went from nonexistence\\nto worldwide popularity, culminating in its commercialization in 1994. The Internet has\\ndramatically changed the way in which we communicate on a daily basis, using a\\nwirelined network.\\nWireless Communications\\nIn 1864, James Clerk Maxwell formulated the electromagnetic theory of light and\\npredicted the existence of radio waves; the set of four equations that connect electric and\\nmagnetic quantities bears his name. Later on in 1984, Henrich Herz demonstrated the\\nexistence of radio waves experimentally.\\nHowever, it was on December 12, 1901, that Guglielmo Marconi received a radio\\nsignal at Signal Hill in Newfoundland; the radio signal had originated in Cornwall,\\nEngland, 2100 miles away across the Atlantic. Last but by no means least, in the early\\ndays of wireless communications, it was Fessenden, a self-educated academic, who in\\n1906 made history by conducting the first radio broadcast, transmitting music and voice\\nusing a technique that came to be known as amplitude modulation (AM) radio.\\nIn 1988, the first digital cellular system was introduced in Europe; it was known as the\\nGlobal System for Mobile (GSM) Communications.

Indeed, the list of\\napplications involving the use of communication in one way or another is almost endless.\\nIn the most fundamental sense, communication involves implicitly the transmission of\\ninformation from one point to another through a succession of processes:\\nThe generation of a message signal - voice, music, picture, or computer data.\\nThe description of that message signal with a certain measure of precision, using a\\nset of symbols - electrical, aural, or visual.\\nThe encoding of those symbols in a suitable form for transmission over a physical\\nmedium of interest.\\nThe transmission of the encoded symbols to the desired destination.\\nThe decoding and reproduction of the original symbols.\\nThe re-creation of the original message signal with some definable degradation in\\nquality, the degradation being caused by unavoidable imperfections in the system.\\nThere are, of course, many other forms of communication that do not directly involve the\\nhuman mind in real time.

Here, information-bearing signals\\nflow only in one direction.\\nPoint-to-point communication, in which the communication process takes place over\\na link between a single transmitter and a receiver. In this case, there is usually a\\nbidirectional flow of information-bearing signals, which requires the combined use\\nof a transmitter and receiver (i.e., a transceiver) at each end of the link.\\nThe underlying communication process in every communication system, irrespective of its\\nkind, is statistical in nature. Indeed, it is for this important reason that much of this book is\\ndevoted to the statistical underpinnings of digital communication systems. In so doing, we\\ndevelop a wealth of knowledge on the fundamental issues involved in the study of digital\\ncommunications. Multiple-Access Techniques\\nContinuing with the communication process, multiple-access is a technique whereby\\nmany subscribers or local stations can share the use of a communication channel at the\\nsame time or nearly so, despite the fact that their individual transmissions may originate\\nfrom widely different locations. Stated in another way, a multiple-access technique\\npermits the communication resources of the channel to be shared by a large number of\\nusers seeking to communicate with each other.\\nThere are subtle differences between multiple access and multiplexing that should be\\nnoted:\\n\\nMultiple access refers to the remote sharing of a communication channel such as a\\nsatellite or radio channel by users in highly dispersed locations. On the other hand,\\nmultiplexing refers to the sharing of a channel such as a telephone channel by users\\nconfined to a local site.',\n",

In contrast, in a\\nmultiple-access system user requirements can change dynamically with time, in\\nwhich case provisions are necessary for dynamic channel allocation.\\nFor obvious reasons it is desirable that in a multiple-access system the sharing of resources\\nof the channel be accomplished without causing serious interference between users of the\\nsystem. In this context, we may identify four basic types of multiple access:\\nFrequency-division multiple access (FDMA).\\nIn this technique, disjoint subbands of frequencies are allocated to the different users\\non a continuous-time basis. In order to reduce interference between users allocated\\nadjacent channel bands, guard bands are used to act as buffer zones, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1.2a. These guard bands are necessary because of the impossibility of\\nachieving ideal filtering or separating the different users.\\nTime-division multiple access (TDMA).\\nIn this second technique, each user is allocated the full spectral occupancy of the\\nchannel, but only for a short duration of time called a time slot.

This is done to reduce interference between users by allowing for time\\nuncertainty that arises due to system imperfections, especially in synchronization\\nschemes.\\nCode-division multiple access (CDMA).\\nIn FDMA, the resources of the channel are shared by dividing them along the\\nfrequency coordinate into disjoint frequency bands, as illustrated in Figure 1.2a. In\\nTDMA, the resources are shared by dividing them along the time coordinate into\\ndisjoint time slots, as illustrated in Figure 1.2b. In Figure 1.2c, we illustrate another\\ntechnique for sharing the channel resources by using a hybrid combination of\\nFDMA and TDMA, which represents a specific form of code-division multiple\\naccess (CDMA). For example, frequency hopping may be employed to ensure that\\nduring each successive time slot, the frequency bands assigned to the users are\\nreordered in an essentially random manner. To be specific, during time slot 1, user\\noccupies frequency band 1, user 2 occupies frequency band 2, user 3 occupies\\nfrequency band 3, and so on. During time slot 2, user 1 hops to frequency band 3,\\nuser 2 hops to frequency band 1, user 3 hops to frequency band 2, and so on. Such an\\narrangement has the appearance of the users playing a game of musical chairs. An\\nimportant advantage of CDMA over both FDMA and TDMA is that it can provide\\nfor secure communications. In the type of CDMA illustrated in Figure 1.2c, the\\nfrequency hopping mechanism can be implemented through the use of a pseudo-\\nnoise (PN) sequence.\\nSpace-division multiple access (SDMA).\\nIn this multiple-access technique, resource allocation is achieved by exploiting the\\nspatial separation of the individual users. In particular, multibeam antennas are used\\nto separate radio signals by pointing them along different directions. Thus, different\\nusers are enabled to access the channel simultaneously on the same frequency or in\\nthe same time slot.',\n",

       " {'chunk': '6 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.4 Networks A communication network or simply network1, illustrated in Figure 1.3, consists of an\\ninterconnection of a number of nodes made up of intelligent processors (e.g.,\\nmicrocomputers). The primary purpose of these nodes is to route data through the\\nnetwork. Each node has one or more stations attached to it; stations refer to devices\\nwishing to communicate. The network is designed to serve as a shared resource for\\nmoving data exchanged between stations in an efficient manner and also to provide a\\nframework to support new applications and services. The traditional telephone network is\\nan example of a communication network in which circuit switching is used to provide a\\ndedicated communication path or circuit between two stations. The circuit consists of a\\nconnected sequence of links from source to destination. The links may consist of time\\nslots in a time-division multiplexed (TDM) system or frequency slots in a frequency-\\ndivision multiplexed (FDM) system. The circuit, once in place, remains uninterrupted for\\nthe entire duration of transmission. Circuit switching is usually controlled by a centralized\\nhierarchical control mechanism with knowledge of the networks organization. To\\nestablish a circuit-switched connection, an available path through the network is seized\\nand then dedicated to the exclusive use of the two stations wishing to communicate. In\\nparticular, a call-request signal must propagate all the way to the destination, and be\\nacknowledged, before transmission can begin. Then, the network is effectively transparent\\nto the users. This means that, during the connection time, the bandwidth and resources\\nallocated to the circuit are essentially owned by the two stations, until the circuit is\\ndisconnected. The circuit thus represents an efficient use of resources only to the extent\\nthat the allocated bandwidth is properly utilized. Although the telephone network is used',\n",

       " {'chunk': '4 Networks In circuit switching, a communication link is shared between the different sessions\\nusing that link on a fixed allocation basis. In packet switching, on the other hand, the\\nsharing is done on a demand basis and, therefore, it has an advantage over circuit\\nswitching in that when a link has traffic to send, the link may be more fully utilized.\\nThe basic network principle of packet switching is store and forward. Specifically, in\\na packet-switched network, any message larger than a specified size is subdivided prior to\\ntransmission into segments not exceeding the specified size. The segments are commonly\\nreferred to as packets. The original message is reassembled at the destination on a packet-\\nby-packet basis. The network may be viewed as a distributed pool of network resources\\n(i.e., channel bandwidth, buffers, and switching processors) whose capacity is shared\\ndynamically by a community of competing users (stations) wishing to communicate. In\\ncontrast, in a circuit-switched network, resources are dedicated to a pair of stations for the\\nentire period they are in session. Accordingly, packet switching is far better suited to a\\ncomputer-communication environment in which bursts of data are exchanged between\\nstations on an occasional basis. The use of packet switching, however, requires that careful\\ncontrol be exercised on user demands; otherwise, the network may be seriously abused.\\nThe design of a data network (i.e., a network in which the stations are all made up of\\ncomputers and terminals) may proceed in an orderly way by looking at the network in\\nterms of a layered architecture, regarded as a hierarchy of nested layers. A layer refers to a\\nprocess or device inside a computer system, designed to perform a specific function.\\nNaturally, the designers of a layer will be intimately familiar with its internal details and\\noperation.

More\\nspecifically, the Fourier transform plays a key role in this representation.\\nThe Fourier transform provides the mathematical link between the time-domain\\nrepresentation (i.e., waveform) of a signal and its frequency-domain description (i.e.,\\nspectrum). Most importantly, we can go back and forth between these two descriptions of\\nthe signal with no loss of information. Indeed, we may invoke a similar transformation in\\nthe representation of linear systems. In this latter case, the time-domain and frequency-\\ndomain descriptions of a linear time-invariant system are defined in terms of its impulse\\nresponse and frequency response, respectively.\\nIn light of this background, it is in order that we begin a mathematical study of\\ncommunication systems by presenting a review of Fourier analysis. This review, in turn,\\npaves the way for the formulation of simplified representations of band-pass signals and\\nsystems to which we resort in subsequent chapters. We begin the study by developing the\\ntransition from the Fourier series representation of a periodic signal to the Fourier\\ntransform representation of a nonperiodic signal; this we do in the next two sections.\\n2 The Fourier Series Let denote a periodic signal, where the subscript T0 denotes the duration of\\nperiodicity.

Specifically:\\nIf a signal is low-pass (i.e., its spectral content is centered around the origin\\nf = 0), the bandwidth is defined as one-half the total width of the main spectral\\nlobe, since only one-half of this lobe lies inside the positive frequency region.\\nFor example, a rectangular pulse of duration T seconds has a main spectral lobe of total\\nwidth (2/T) hertz centered at the origin. Accordingly, we may define the bandwidth of this\\nrectangular pulse as (1/T) hertz.\\nIf, on the other hand, the signal is band-pass with main spectral lobes centered around\\nfc, where fc is large enough, the bandwidth is defined as the width of the main lobe for\\npositive frequencies.

       " {'chunk': '14 Linear Modulation Theory We start this treatment with a formal definition:\\nModulation is a process by means of which one or more parameters of a\\nsinusoidal carrier are varied in accordance with a message signal so as to\\nfacilitate transmission of that signal over a communication channel.\\nThe message signal (e.g., voice, video, data sequence) is referred to as the modulating\\nsignal, and the result of the modulation process is referred to as the modulated signal.\\nNaturally, in a communication system, modulation is performed in the transmitter. The\\nreverse of modulation, aimed at recovery of the original message signal in the receiver, is\\ncalled demodulation.\\nConsider the block diagram of Figure 2.23, depicting a modulator, where m(t) is the\\nmessage signal, cos(2fct) is the carrier, and s(t) is the modulated signal. To apply (2.68)\\nto this modulator, the in-phase component sI(t) in that equation is treated simply as a\\nscaled version of the message signal denoted by m(t). As for the quadrature component\\nsQ(t), it is defined by a spectrally shaped version of m(t) that is performed linearly. In such\\na scenario, it follows that a modulated signal s(t) defined by (2.68) is a linear function of\\nthe message signal m(t); hence the reference to this equation as the mathematical basis of\\nlinear modulation theory.\\nTo recover the original message signal m(t) from the modulated signal s(t), we may use\\na demodulator, the block diagram of which is depicted in Figure 2.24. An elegant feature\\nof linear modulation theory is that demodulation of s(t) is also achieved using linear\\noperations. However, for linear demodulation of s(t) to be feasible, the locally generated\\ncarrier in the demodulator of Figure 2.24 has to be synchronous with the original\\nsinusoidal carrier used in the modulator of Figure 2.23.

By using two phasors to represent the input signal and the received signal, we\\nsee that the received signal phasor lags the input signal phasor by (fc) radians. The time\\ntaken by the received signal phasor to sweep out this phase lag is simply equal to the ratio\\n(fc)/(2fc) seconds. This time is called the phase delay of the channel.\\nIt is important to realize, however, that the phase delay is not necessarily the true signal\\ndelay. This follows from the fact that a steady sinusoidal signal does not carry information,\\nso it would be incorrect to deduce from the above reasoning that the phase delay is the true\\nsignal delay.

Summary and Discussion\\nIn this chapter we have described the Fourier transform as a fundamental tool for relating\\nthe time-domain and frequency-domain descriptions of a deterministic signal. The signal\\nof interest may be an energy signal or a power signal. The Fourier transform includes the\\nexponential Fourier series as a special case, provided that we permit the use of the Dirac\\ndelta function.\\nAn inverse relationship exists between the time-domain and frequency-domain\\ndescriptions of a signal. Whenever an operation is performed on the waveform of a signal\\nin the time domain, a corresponding modification is applied to the spectrum of the signal\\nin the frequency domain. An important consequence of this inverse relationship is the fact\\nthat the time-bandwidth product of an energy signal is a constant; the definitions of signal\\nduration and bandwidth merely affect the value of the constant.\\nAn important signal-processing operation frequently encountered in communication\\nsystems is that of linear filtering. This operation involves the convolution of the input\\nsignal with the impulse response of the filter or, equivalently, the multiplication of the\\nFourier transform of the input signal by the transfer function (i.e., Fourier transform of the\\nimpulse response) of the filter. Low-pass and band-pass filters represent two commonly\\nused types of filters. Band-pass filtering is usually more complicated than low-pass\\nfiltering.

In this context, we may distinguish\\ntwo classes of mathematical models: deterministic and probabilistic. A model is said to be\\ndeterministic if there is no uncertainty about its time-dependent behavior at any instant of\\ntime; linear time-invariant systems considered in Chapter 2 are examples of a\\ndeterministic model. However, in many real-world problems, the use of a deterministic\\nmodel is inappropriate because the underlying physical phenomenon involves too many\\nunknown factors. In such situations, we resort to a probabilistic model that accounts for\\nuncertainty in mathematical terms.\\nProbabilistic models are needed for the design of systems that are reliable in\\nperformance in the face of uncertainty, efficient in computational terms, and cost effective\\nin building them. Consider for example, a digital communication system that is required to\\nprovide practically error-free communication across a wireless channel. Unfortunately, the\\nwireless channel is subject to uncertainties, the sources of which include:\\n\\nnoise, internally generated due to thermal agitation of electrons in the conductors\\nand electronic devices at the front-end of the receiver;\\n\\nfading of the channel, due to the multipath phenomenon-an inherent characteristic\\nof wireless channels;\\n\\ninterference, representing spurious electromagnetic waves emitted by other\\ncommunication systems or microwave devices operating in the vicinity of the receiver.\\nTo account for these uncertainties in the design of a wireless communication system, we\\nneed a probabilistic model of the wireless channel.\\nThe objective of this chapter, devoted to probability theory, is twofold:\\n\\nthe formulation of a logical basis for the mathematical description of probabilistic\\nmodels and',\n",

A parameter vector , drawn from the parameter\\nspace, is mapped probabilistically onto the observation space, producing the observation\\nvector x. The vector x is the sample value of a random vector X, which provides the\\nFigure 3.11 Simulation supporting validity of the central limit theorem.\\nProbability density fX (x)\\nx -4 -2 0 2 4 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 Simulated density of 5 uniforms\\nGaussian density with same mean\\nand variance',\n",

As with Example 7, the sum of the xi over the N\\nobservations; that is,\\nis a sufficient statistic for the problem at hand.

As before, we\\nassume that a decision must be made as to which one of the M possible source outputs was\\nactually emitted, given an observation vector x.\\nTo develop insight into how to construct a decision rule for testing multiple hypotheses,\\nwe consider first the case of M = 3 and then generalize the result. Moreover, in formulating\\nthe decision rule, we will use probabilistic reasoning that builds on the findings of the\\nbinary hypothesis-testing procedure. In this context, however, we find it more convenient\\nto work with likelihood functions rather than likelihood ratios.\\nTo proceed then, suppose we make a measurement on the probabilistic transition\\nmechanisms output, obtaining the observation vector x. We use this observation vector\\nand knowledge of the probability law characterizing the transition mechanism to construct\\nthree likelihood functions, one for each of the three possible hypotheses.

Moreover, their\\nactual behavior has a random appearance. Referring back to the example of wireless\\ncommunications briefly described in Section 3.1, we find that the received signal at the\\nwireless channel output varies randomly with time. Processes of this kind are said to be\\nrandom or stochastic;1 hereafter, we will use the term stochastic. Although probability\\ntheory does not involve time, the study of stochastic processes naturally builds on\\nprobability theory.\\nThe way to think about the relationship between probability theory and stochastic\\nprocesses is as follows. When we consider the statistical characterization of a stochastic\\nprocess at a particular instant of time, we are basically dealing with the characterization of\\na random variable sampled (i.e., observed) at that instant of time. When, however, we\\nconsider a single realization of the process, we have a random waveform that evolves\\nacross time. The study of stochastic processes, therefore, embodies two approaches: one\\nbased on ensemble averaging and the other based on temporal averaging. Both\\napproaches and their characterizations are considered in this chapter.\\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the exact value of a signal drawn from a stochastic\\nprocess, it is possible to characterize the process in terms of statistical parameters such as\\naverage power, correlation functions, and power spectra. This chapter is devoted to the\\nmathematical definitions, properties, and measurements of these functions, and related issues.

For a source code representing the output of this source to\\nbe of practical use, the code has to be uniquely decodable. This restriction ensures that, for\\neach finite sequence of symbols emitted by the source, the corresponding sequence of\\ncodewords is different from the sequence of codewords corresponding to any other source\\nsequence. We are specifically interested in a special class of codes satisfying a restriction\\nknown as the prefix condition. To define the prefix condition, let the codeword assigned to\\nsource symbol sk be denoted by\\n, where the individual elements are 0s and 1s and n is the codeword length. The initial part of the codeword\\nis represented by the elements for some i  n. Any sequence made up of the\\ninitial part of the codeword is called a prefix of the codeword. We thus say:\\nA prefix code is defined as a code in which no codeword is the prefix of any\\nother codeword.\\nPrefix codes are distinguished from other uniquely decodable codes by the fact that the\\nend of a codeword is always recognizable. Hence, the decoding of a prefix can be\\naccomplished as soon as the binary sequence representing a source symbol is fully\\nreceived. For this reason, prefix codes are also referred to as instantaneous codes.\\nEXAMPLE\\nIllustrative Example of Prefix Coding',\n",

       " {'chunk': '4 Lossless Data Compression Algorithms Decoding of Prefix Code\\nTo decode a sequence of codewords generated from a prefix source code, the source\\ndecoder simply starts at the beginning of the sequence and decodes one codeword at a\\ntime. Specifically, it sets up what is equivalent to a decision tree, which is a graphical\\nportrayal of the codewords in the particular source code. For example, Figure 5.4 depicts\\nthe decision tree corresponding to code II in Table 5.2. The tree has an initial state and\\nfour terminal states corresponding to source symbols s0, s1, s2, and s3. The decoder always\\nstarts at the initial state. The first received bit moves the decoder to the terminal state s0 if\\nit is 0 or else to a second decision point if it is 1. In the latter case, the second bit moves the\\ndecoder one step further down the tree, either to terminal state s1 if it is 0 or else to a third\\ndecision point if it is 1, and so on. Once each terminal state emits its symbol, the decoder\\nis reset to its initial state. Note also that each bit in the received encoded sequence is\\nexamined only once. Consider, for example, the following encoded sequence:\\nThis sequence is readily decoded as the source sequence s1s3s2s0s0 The reader is\\ninvited to carry out this decoding.\\nAs mentioned previously, a prefix code has the important property that it is\\ninstantaneously decodable. But the converse is not necessarily true. For example, code III\\nin Table 5.2 does not satisfy the prefix condition, yet it is uniquely decodable because the\\nbit 0 indicates the beginning of each codeword in the code.\\nTo probe more deeply into prefix codes, exemplified by that in Table 5.2, we resort to\\nan inequality, which is considered next.\\nKraft Inequality\\nConsider a discrete memoryless source with source alphabet {s0, s1, , sK - 1} and source\\nprobabilities {p0, p1, , pK - 1}, with the codeword of symbol sk having length lk, k = 0, 1,\\nFigure 5.4 Decision tree for code II of Table 5.2.',\n",

The approach taken is to introduce redundancy in the channel encoder in a\\ncontrolled manner, so as to reconstruct the original source sequence as accurately as\\npossible. In a rather loose sense, we may thus view channel coding as the dual of source\\ncoding, in that the former introduces controlled redundancy to improve reliability whereas\\nthe latter reduces redundancy to improve efficiency.\\nTreatment of the channel-coding techniques is deferred to Chapter 10. For the purpose\\nof our present discussion, it suffices to confine our attention to block codes. In this class of\\ncodes, the message sequence is subdivided into sequential blocks each k bits long, and\\neach k-bit block is mapped into an n-bit block, where n > k. The number of redundant bits\\nadded by the encoder to each transmitted block is n - k bits. The ratio kn is called the code\\nrate. Using r to denote the code rate, we write\\n(5.61)\\nwhere, of course, r is less than unity. For a prescribed k, the code rate r (and, therefore, the\\nsystems coding efficiency) approaches zero as the block length n approaches infinity.\\nThe accurate reconstruction of the original source sequence at the destination requires\\nthat the average probability of symbol error be arbitrarily low. This raises the following\\nimportant question:\\nDoes a channel-coding scheme exist such that the probability that a message bit\\nwill be in error is less than any positive number  (i.e., as small as we want it),\\nand yet the channel-coding scheme is efficient in that the code rate need not be\\ntoo small?\\nThe answer to this fundamental question is an emphatic yes.

In\\nthe case of a binary PCM system, the presence of a bit error causes symbol 1 to be\\nmistaken for symbol 0, or vice versa. Clearly, the more frequently bit errors occur, the\\nmore dissimilar the receiver output becomes compared with the original message signal.\\nThe fidelity of information transmission by PCM in the presence of channel noise may be\\nmeasured in terms of the average probability of symbol error, which is defined as the\\nprobability that the reconstructed symbol at the receiver output differs from the\\ntransmitted binary symbol on the average. The average probability of symbol error, also\\nreferred to as the BER, assumes that all the bits in the original binary wave are of equal\\nimportance. When, however, there is more interest in restructuring the analog waveform of\\nthe original message signal, different symbol errors may be weighted differently; for\\nexample, an error in the most significant bit in a codeword (representing a quantized\\nsample of the message signal) is more harmful than an error in the least significant bit.\\nTo optimize system performance in the presence of channel noise, we need to minimize\\nthe average probability of symbol error. For this evaluation, it is customary to model the\\nchannel noise as an ideal additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

Based on this equation, Figure 7.36 plots the\\noperating points for different phase-level numbers M = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. Each point on\\nthe operating curve corresponds to an average probability of symbol error Pe = 10-5; this\\nvalue of Pe is small enough to assume error-free transmission. Given this fixed value of\\nPe, (7.132) for the coherent detection of M-ary PSK is used to calculate the symbol\\nenergy-to-noise density ratio EN0 and, therefore, EbN0 for a prescribed M; Figure 7.36\\nalso includes the capacity boundary for the ideal transmission system, computed in\\naccordance with (5.99). Figure 7.36 teaches us the following:\\nIn M-ary PSK using coherent detection, increasing M improves the bandwidth\\nefficiency, but the Eb/N0 required for the idealized condition of error-free\\ntransmission moves away from the Shannon limit as M is increased.\\nConsider next an M-ary FSK system that uses an orthogonal set of M frequency-shifted\\nsignals for the transmission of binary data over an AWGN channel.

The set of signal vectors so formed defines a\\nsignal constellation in an N-dimensional signal space.\\nFor a given signal constellation, the (average) probability of symbol error, Pe, incurred\\nin maximum likelihood signal detection over an AWGN channel is invariant to rotation of\\nthe signal constellation as well as its translation.

In other words, there was no\\nlimitation imposed on the channel bandwidth, with the energy per bit to noise spectral\\ndensity ratio Eb/N0 being the only factor to affect the performance of the receiver. In\\nreality, however, every physical channel is not only noisy, but also limited to some finite\\nbandwidth. Hence the title of this chapter: signaling over band-limited channels.\\nThe important point to note here is that if, for example, a rectangular pulse, represent-\\ning one bit of information, is applied to the channel input, the shape of the pulse will be\\ndistorted at the channel output. Typically, the distorted pulse may consist of a main lobe\\nrepresenting the original bit of information surrounded by a long sequence of sidelobes on\\neach side of the main lobe. The sidelobes represent a new source of channel distortion,\\nreferred to as intersymbol interference, so called because of its degrading influence on the\\nadjacent bits of information.\\nThere is a fundamental difference between intersymbol interference and channel noise\\nthat could be summarized as follows:\\n\\nChannel noise is independent of the transmitted signal; its effect on data\\ntransmission over the band-limited channel shows up at the receiver input, once the\\ndata transmission system is switched on.',\n",

The matched filter is followed by a sampler, and then finally a\\ndecision device. To simplify matters, it is assumed that the symbols 1 and 0 are equally\\nlikely; the threshold in the decision device, namely\\n, may then be set equal to zero. If\\nthis threshold is exceeded, the receiver decides in favor of symbol 1; if not, it decides in\\nfavor of symbol 0.

For an implementable\\nsystem operating at low enough probability of symbol error, we thus need to introduce an\\nSNR gap or just gap, denoted by . The gap is a function of the permissible probability of\\nsymbol error Pe and the encoding system of interest.

Let the magnitude response of the\\nchannel, denoted by |H( f )|, be approximated by a staircase function as illustrated in Figure\\n24, with f denoting the width of each frequency step (i.e., subchannel).

Under this assumption, the issue of\\ndealing with intersymbol interference was viewed as a signal design problem. That is, the\\noverall pulse shape p(t) is configured in such a way that p(t) is zero at the sampling times\\nnTb, where Tb is the reciprocal of the bit rate Rb. In so doing, the intersymbol interference\\nis reduced to zero. Finding the pulse shape that satisfies this requirement is best handled in\\nthe frequency domain. The ideal solution is a brick-wall spectrum that is constant over\\nthe interval -W  f  W where W = 12Tb. Tb is the bit duration and W is called the Nyquist\\nbandwidth. Unfortunately, this ideal pulse shape is impractical on two accounts: noncausal\\nbehavior and sensitivity to timing errors. To overcome these two practical difficulties, we\\nproposed the use of an RC spectrum that rolls off gradually from a constant value over a\\nprescribed band toward zero in a half-cosine-like manner on either side of the band. We\\nfinished this first part of the chapter by introducing the SRRC spectrum, where the overall\\npulse shaping is split equally between the transmitter and receiver; this latter form of\\nsignal design finds application in wireless communication.\\nTurning next to the second part of the chapter, we discussed another way of tackling\\ndata transmission over a wideband channel by applying the engineering principle of\\ndivide and conquer.

In this chapter we go on to study a more complicated communications environment,\\nnamely a fading channel, which is at the very core of ever-expanding wireless communica-\\ntions. Fading refers to the fact that even though the distance separating a mobile receiver\\nfrom the transmitter is essentially constant, a relatively small movement of the receiver\\naway from the transmitter could result in a significant change in the received power. The\\nphysical phenomenon responsible for fading is multipath, which means that the transmitted\\nsignal reaches the mobile receiver via multiple paths with varying spatio-temporal charac-\\nteristics, hence the challenging nature of the wireless channel for reliable communication.\\nThis chapter consists of three related parts:\\nFirst we study signaling over a fading channel by characterizing its statistical behavior\\nin temporal as well as spacial terms. This statistical characterization is carried out from\\nthree different perspectives: physical, mathematical, and computational, each of which\\nenriches our understanding of the multipath phenomenon in its own way.

Propagation Effects\\nThe major propagation problems1 encountered in the use of mobile radio in built-up areas\\nare due to the fact that the antenna of a mobile unit may lie well below the surrounding\\nbuildings. Simply put, there is no line-of-sight path to the base station. Instead, radio\\npropagation takes place mainly by way of scattering from the surfaces of the surrounding\\nbuildings and by diffraction over and/or around them, as illustrated in Figure 9.1. The\\nimportant point to note from Figure 9.1 is that energy reaches the receiving antenna via\\nmore than one path. Accordingly, we speak of a multipath phenomenon, in that the various\\nincoming radio waves reach their destination from different directions and with different\\ntime delays.\\nTo understand the nature of the multipath phenomenon, consider first a static\\nmultipath environment involving a stationary receiver and a transmitted signal that\\nconsists of a narrowband signal (e.g., unmodulated sinusoidal carrier). Let it be assumed\\nthat two attenuated versions of the transmitted signal arrive sequentially at the receiver.\\nThe effect of the differential time delay is to introduce a relative phase shift between any\\ntwo components of the received signal.

Historically, these codes have been classified into block codes\\nand convolutional codes. The distinguishing feature for this particular classification is the\\npresence or absence of memory in the encoders for the two codes.\\nTo generate an (n, k) block code, the channel encoder accepts information in successive\\nk-bit blocks; for each block, it adds n - k redundant bits that are algebraically related to\\nthe k message bits, thereby producing an overall encoded block of n bits, where n > k. The\\nn-bit block is called a codeword, and n is called the block length of the code. The channel\\nencoder produces bits at the rate R0 = (nk)Rs, where Rs is the bit rate of the information\\nsource. The dimensionless ratio r = kn is called the code rate, where 0 < r < 1. The bit\\nrate R0, coming out of the encoder, is called the channel data rate. Thus, the code rate is a\\ndimensionless ratio, whereas the data rate produced by the source and the channel data\\nrate produced by the encoder are both measured in bits per second.\\nIn a convolutional code, the encoding operation may be viewed as the discrete-time\\nconvolution of the input sequence with the impulse response of the encoder. The duration\\nof the impulse response equals the memory of the encoder. Accordingly, the encoder for a\\nconvolutional code operates on the incoming message sequence, using a sliding window\\nequal in duration to its own memory. This, in turn, means that in a convolutional code,\\nunlike in a block code, the channel encoder accepts message bits as a continuous sequence\\nand thereby generates a continuous sequence of encoded bits at a higher rate.\\nIn the model depicted in Figure 10.1a, the operations of channel coding and modulation\\nare performed separately in the transmitter; and likewise for the operations of detection',\n",

In Chapter 3, multiple antennas were used to provide diversity gain and\\nincrease the reliability of wireless links. Both receive and transmit diversity were con-\\nsidered. Moreover, receive antennas can also provide a power gain. In Chapter 5, we\\nsaw that with channel knowledge at the transmitter, multiple transmit antennas can\\nalso provide a power gain via transmit beamforming. In Chapter 6, multiple transmit\\nantennas were used to induce channel variations, which can then be exploited by op-\\nportunistic communication techniques. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic\\nbeamforming and provides a power gain as well.\\nIn this and the next few chapters, we will study a new way to use multiple antennas.\\nWe will see that under suitable channel fading conditions, having both multiple transmit\\nand multiple receive antennas (i.e., a MIMO channel) provides an additional spatial\\ndimension for communication and yields a degree-of-freedom gain. These additional\\ndegrees of freedom can be exploited by spatially multiplexing several data streams onto\\nthe MIMO channel, and lead to an increase in the capacity: the capacity of such a\\nMIMO channel with n transmit and receive antennas is proportional to n.\\nHistorically, it has been known for a while that a multiple access system with mul-\\ntiple antennas at the base station allows several users to simultaneously communicate\\nwith the base station. The multiple antennas allow spatial separation of the signals\\nfrom the dierent users. It has been observed in the mid 1990s that a similar eect\\ncan occur for a point-to-point channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas,\\ni.e., even when the transmit antennas are not geographically far apart. This holds\\nprovided that the scattering environment is rich enough to allow the receive antennas',\n",

In light of (7.221), the binary-hypothesis test may now be formulated as follows:\\nThe modified Bessel function I() is a monotonically increasing function of its argument.\\nHence, we may simplify the hypothesis test by focusing on i for given E/N0T. For\\nconvenience of implementation, however, the simplified hypothesis test is carried out in\\nterms of rather than i; that is to say:\\n(7.222)\\nFor obvious reasons, a receiver based on (7.222) is known as the quadratic receiver. In\\nlight of the definition of i given in (7.216), the receiver structure for computing i is as\\nshown in Figure 7.38a. Since the test described in (7.222) is independent of the symbol\\nenergy E, this hypothesis test is said to be uniformly most powerful with respect to E.\\nTwo Equivalent Forms of the Quadratic Receiver\\nWe next derive two equivalent forms of the quadrature receiver shown in Figure 7.38a.\\nThe first form is obtained by replacing each correlator in this receiver with a\\ncorresponding equivalent matched filter. We thus obtain the alternative form of quadrature\\nreceiver shown in Figure 7.38b. In one branch of this receiver, we have a filter matched to\\nthe signal cos(2fit) and in the other branch we have a filter matched to sin(2fit), both of\\nwhich are defined for the signaling interval 0  t  T.

When frequency hopping is enabled for PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of [4, TS 38.211]. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0_1 and for resource allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config',\n",

In solving the input\\ndistribution optimization problem (B.22) for the capacity C, it was remarked that\\nat the optimal solution, the outputs y[m]s should be independent, and one way to\\nachieve this is for the inputs x[m]s to be independent. Does that imply no coding is\\nneeded to achieve capacity? For example, in the binary symmetric channel, the optimal\\ninput yields i.i.d. equally likely symbols; does it mean then we can send equally likely\\ninformation bits raw across the channel and still achieve capacity?\\nOf course not: to get very small error probability one needs to code over many\\nsymbols. The fallacy of the above argument is that reliable communication cannot be\\nachieved at exactly the rate C and when the outputs are exactly independent. Indeed,\\nwhen the outputs and inputs are i.i.d,\\nH(x|y) = NXm=1 H(x[m]|y[m]) = NH(x[m]|y[m]),\\n(B.32)\\nand there is a lot of uncertainty in the input given the output: the communication\\nis hardly reliable. But once one shoots for a rate strictly less than C, no matter how\\nclose, the coding theorem guarantees that reliable communication is possible. The\\nmutual information I(x; y)/N per symbol is close to C, the outputs y[m]s are almost\\nindependent, but now the conditional entropy H(x|y) is reduced abruptly to (close\\nto) zero since reliable decoding is possible. But to achieve this performance, coding is\\ncrucial; indeed the entropy per input symbol is close to I(x; y)/N, less than H(x[m])\\nunder uncoded transmission. For the binary symmetric channel, the entropy per coded\\nsymbol is 1 H(), rather than 1 for uncoded symbols.\\nThe bottomline is that while the value of the input optimization problem (B.22) has\\noperational meaning as the maximum rate of reliable communication, it is incorrect\\nto interpret the i.i.d. input distribution which attains that value as the statistics of',\n",

In other words, within the\\nfinite amplitude range of the signal, we find an infinite number of amplitude levels. In\\nactual fact, however, it is not necessary to transmit the exact amplitudes of the samples for\\nthe following reason: any human sense (the ear or the eye) as ultimate receiver can detect\\nonly finite intensity differences. This means that the message signal may be approximated\\nby a signal constructed of discrete amplitudes selected on a minimum error basis from an\\navailable set. The existence of a finite number of discrete amplitude levels is a basic\\ncondition of waveform coding exemplified by PCM. Clearly, if we assign the discrete\\namplitude levels with sufficiently close spacing, then we may make the approximated\\nsignal practically indistinguishable from the original message signal.

That is, instead of being isolated events, transmission\\nerrors due to fast fading tend to occur in bursts.\\nNow, most FEC channel codes are designed to deal with a limited number of bit errors,\\nassumed to be randomly distributed and statistically independent from one bit to the next.\\nTo be specific, in Section 10.8 on convolutional decoding, we indicated that the Viterbi\\nalgorithm, as powerful as it is, will fail if there are dfree2 closely spaced bit errors in the\\nreceived signal, where dfree is the free distance of the convolutional code. Accordingly, in\\nthe design of a reliable wireless communication system, we are confronted with two\\nconflicting phenomena:',\n",

The approach taken is to introduce redundancy in the channel encoder in a\\ncontrolled manner, so as to reconstruct the original source sequence as accurately as\\npossible. In a rather loose sense, we may thus view channel coding as the dual of source\\ncoding, in that the former introduces controlled redundancy to improve reliability whereas\\nthe latter reduces redundancy to improve efficiency.\\nTreatment of the channel-coding techniques is deferred to Chapter 10. For the purpose\\nof our present discussion, it suffices to confine our attention to block codes. In this class of\\ncodes, the message sequence is subdivided into sequential blocks each k bits long, and\\neach k-bit block is mapped into an n-bit block, where n > k. The number of redundant bits\\nadded by the encoder to each transmitted block is n - k bits. The ratio kn is called the code\\nrate. Using r to denote the code rate, we write\\n(5.61)\\nwhere, of course, r is less than unity. For a prescribed k, the code rate r (and, therefore, the\\nsystems coding efficiency) approaches zero as the block length n approaches infinity.\\nThe accurate reconstruction of the original source sequence at the destination requires\\nthat the average probability of symbol error be arbitrarily low. This raises the following\\nimportant question:\\nDoes a channel-coding scheme exist such that the probability that a message bit\\nwill be in error is less than any positive number  (i.e., as small as we want it),\\nand yet the channel-coding scheme is efficient in that the code rate need not be\\ntoo small?\\nThe answer to this fundamental question is an emphatic yes. Indeed, the answer to the\\nquestion is provided by Shannons second theorem in terms of the channel capacity C, as\\ndescribed in what follows.',\n",

In such a code, the encoding and decoding\\nfunctions involve the binary arithmetic operations of modulo-2 addition and multiplication\\nperformed on codewords in the code.\\nThroughout this chapter, we use the ordinary plus sign (+) to denote modulo-2 addition.\\nThe use of this terminology will not lead to confusion because the whole chapter relies on\\nbinary arithmetic. In so doing, we avoid use of the special symbol as we did in previous\\nparts of the book. Thus, according to the notation used in this chapter, the rules for\\nmodulo-2 addition are as follows:\\nBecause 1 + 1 = 0, it follows that 1 = -1. Hence, in binary arithmetic, subtraction is the\\nsame as addition. The rules for modulo-2 multiplication are as follows:\\nDivision is trivial, in that we have\\nand division by 0 is not permitted. Modulo-2 addition is the EXCLUSIVE-OR operation\\nin logic and modulo-2 multiplication is the AND operation.\\n4 Linear Block Codes By definition: A code is said to be linear if any two codewords in the code can be added in\\nmodulo-2 arithmetic to produce a third codeword in the code.\\nConsider, then, an (n,k) linear block code, in which k bits of the n code bits are always\\nidentical to the message sequence to be transmitted. The (n - k) bits in the remaining\\nportion are computed from the message bits in accordance with a prescribed encoding rule\\nthat determines the mathematical structure of the code. Accordingly, these (n - k) bits are\\nreferred to as parity-check bits. Block codes in which the message bits are transmitted in\\nunaltered form are called systematic codes. For applications requiring both error detection\\nand error correction, the use of systematic block codes simplifies implementation of the\\ndecoder.\\nLet m0, m1, , mk - 1 constitute a block of k arbitrary message bits.

If the field is absent the UE applies no offset (value 0). spatialRelationInfo Configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and the target SRS. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). This parameter is not applicable to CLI SRS-RSRP measurement. This field is not configured if unifiedTCI-StateType is configured for the serving cell. spatialRelationInfo-PDC Configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and the target SRS. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS/DL-PRS-PDC (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). The field is present in case of resourceType=periodic and usagePDC-r17=true in the SRS-ResourceSet, otherwise the field is absent\",\n",
